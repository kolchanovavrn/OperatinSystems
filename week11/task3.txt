case a:

string is "Hello".
fork() calls a child and a parent process
    each contains in their buffers "Hello" string.
after \n - text is printed and buffer is emptied
    that is for each buffer of child and parent processes ==>
        "Hello" is printed twice.

case b:

string is "Hello/n"
after "/n" symbol a buffer is emptied
    (each time when in buffer writed for putput flow a "/n" symbol)
hence after fork() call the buffer is emptied ==>
    "Hello" is printed once.
