Let's get a case when Miss amount will be constant while Hit amount will be равномерно increasing.

Supposse, we have 5 frames and the sequence of page references consist of repetitions only of "1","2","3","4","5".

In such case Miss amount will increase every time whin we looking for a new number of page. Totally, we have 5 pages, so Miss amount will be from 0 till 5.

What about hit amount - it will increase, because of number of frames is not less than amount of pages.

Tadaaam!
